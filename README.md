This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within request handlers cause server unresponsiveness. The bug involves a POST request handler that simulates a 5-second delay using `setTimeout`. This delay blocks the event loop preventing other requests from being processed, resulting in apparent server freezes and client-side timeout errors. The solution involves using asynchronous techniques like promises or async/await to prevent blocking the event loop while the asynchronous operation completes.
